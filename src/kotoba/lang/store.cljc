  "Capability-guarded KV store over an injected filesystem. A real consumer of
  the kotoba-lang foundational stdlib: fs (IFilesystem backend), io (byte
  streaming), wit (deny-by-default capability gating), coll (key/path shaping).

  A capability-confined cell must not touch storage it wasn't granted. store
  composes the stdlib: fs provides the backend (host-injected IFilesystem), io
  streams the bytes, wit gates every read/write behind a deny-by-default
  capability token (store:read / store:write). Without a granted capability an
  op returns ::denied.

  Zero third-party runtime deps; .cljc (JVM / SCI / CLJS / GraalVM / kotoba-WASM)."
